Today we rolled out a small update for Borderlands 4 on all platforms, which improves crossplay.

Please note that on PC, you may see a command window briefly pop up as a result of this update. This is an expected behavior and will not impact your game or machine. Please restart Borderlands 4 if you're currently playing to ensure that this update goes through. You may close the pop-up if it appears. We apologize for the inconvenience!
