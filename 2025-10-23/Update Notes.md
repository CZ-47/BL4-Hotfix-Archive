TY DECEPTIX FOR THE HOTFIX FILES

Hello, Vault Hunters! Can you believe we’ve already shared more than a month of mayhem together in Borderlands 4?! To celebrate, we have an update that includes widespread stability improvements, multiplayer fixes, UI polish, and a suite of quality-of-life upgrades across visuals, audio, and accessibility. It also addresses various reported issues for Vault Hunters including major balance tuning, loot systems, gear, and achievements—further refining late-game, mission flow, and overall player experience.

We will monitor the community closely for feedback and respond after the changes have settled. This measured approach to your input will provide a consistent and better experience. As a reminder, our primary goal with balance adjustments is to provide you the greatest number of viable builds.

To all PC players with NVIDIA GeForce hardware: We highly encourage you to update to the latest drivers 581.57 that were released on Tuesday, October 14, as NVIDIA has addressed a number of GPU crashes.

Please restart your game to ensure the update goes through and prevent connection errors in matchmaking.

If you encounter issues, please contact 2K Support for direct assistance. You can also read the PC Troubleshooting Guide, a list of known issues, or browse a list of Support threads here.
Change List:
Horrors of Kairos!

    Added support for the Horrors of Kairos! This free mini-event will be live from October 23 to November 6.
    Added the "Murmur" Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle and "Skully" Legendary Order Grenade to the rewards for world bosses across Kairos! These special drops will only be available during Horrors of Kairos, and delivered to the Reward Center. These do not change the rates on any other gear for that boss.

Creative Bursts

Balance Adjustments: 

    Neutron Capture now converts all Gun Damage into radiation, and now only applies to Gun Shots, and not all instances of Gun Damage.
        Dev Note: Neutron Capture is one of the best damage scalars in the entire game, but during testing, we found that this was erroneously applying to all instances of Gun Damage and was able to scale in unanticipated ways as a result. This new change will still see Neutron Capture being one of the best (if not the best) damage scalars in the game, but the power level will be much more in line with our expectations. Additionally, since all damage from the Gun is converted into Radiation, it should have more scaling vectors for clever build crafters, and allow for meaningful boosts from Gun Damage. 

Cosmic Brilliance - Passive

    Flux Generator + Annihilation interaction updated so spawned grenades now scale correctly with character level

Amon the Forgeknight

    Shield visuals adjusted for improved clarity in combat situations

Trait - Forgeskill

    Adjusted interaction with Forge Master class mod so Forgeskill now respects its cooldown in multiplayer

Onslaughter - Calamity

    Camera behavior stabilized when combining Onslaughter with Order Legendary Pistol Noisy Cricket
    Attack frequency of Rocket Punch is now consistent in multiplayer

Balance Adjustments 

    There Is Only Red Duration restored no longer increases per point invested, and is now 4 seconds for all ranks.
        Dev Note: There Is Only Red was always meant to have huge damage scaling potential, but was always meant to be hard to maintain. We didn't want to nerf this passive's power, but we're making the effect harder to maintain. 

Scourge - Vengeance

    Scorched Kairos passive now displays consistent magazine size values for the Ordnance gadget
    The Forgewave no longer fires unintentionally during Glacial Rapture
    Projectiles no longer get stuck in the air when Forgemaster Firewall is active during the Fortress Indomita boss fight
    Blackout Shock Damage now properly scales with points invested
    Blackout is now 15% per point, down from 21% per point
        Dev Note: After fixing the scaling of the DoT (damage over time), we found that Blackout was overperforming a bit, so we gave it a slight re-adjustment. This will still be an overall buff, now that the DoT properly scales.

Crucible - Cybernetics

    Visuals corrected so Forgeaxes no longer disappear when activating Crucible at the same time as throwing with Double-Edge
    Corrected animation of Crucible while climbing
    Raging Inferno Incendiary Damage now properly scales with points invested

Vex the Siren

    Challenge “Me, Myself, Myself, and I.” now tracks correctly in multiplayer, independent of clone duration on other players

Dead Ringer - The Fourth Seal

    Specter’s copied weapon now displays proper visual effects when firing with a Maliwan Element Switcher

Incarnate - Vexcalation

    Bleed from Bloodletter has been updated so it no longer recursively triggers itself, preventing unintended damage loops

Phase Phamiliar - Here Comes Trouble

Balance Adjustments

    Double Trouble Illusion Damage Multiplier is now 75%, up from 50%
    Double Trouble Illusion's Duration is now 8 seconds, up from 5 seconds
    Apex Beast Damage Dealt increase increased to 15% from 10% per stack of Unsealed

Rafa the Exo-Soldier

    Free Grenade from Filantropo class mod now deals appropriate damage even when no grenade is equipped

People Person skill tree

Action Skills - APOPHIS Lance

    APOPHIS Lance changed to penalize Gun Accuracy instead of Gun Handling, resulting in projectile speed being unaffected.
    APOPHIS Lance now benefits from cooldown reduction effects

Gear

    Addressed reports that swapping weapons with the Free Loader Enhancement on an Order weapon with a Ripper magazine would cause all weapons to not consume the accurate amount of ammo

    Using a Jakobs Shotgun with Torgue sticky projectiles and the Knife Launcher underbarrel no longer deals knife damage after switching fire modes
    Jakobs weapon parts updated so ricochet effects only trigger from intended damage sources

Other Gear:

Specializations

Groundbreaker: 

    Groundbreaker now only stores Gun, Action Skill, and Ordnance damage.
        Dev Note: Groundbreaker was causing recursive loops that could lead to infinite damage by storing “Bonus Damage” across the board. We still want this skill to be effective, but it should not be able to scale infinitely. We’ll be monitoring Melee builds after this change to make sure they are meeting expectations, and will further adjust if necessary. This ultimately had to be fixed so we can establish a baseline before we investigate further buffs/changes.
