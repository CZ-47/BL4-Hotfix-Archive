Change Notes:

    Forgeknight's Dragon's Breath passive and Exo-Soldier's First Impression passive have been adjusted to apply the bonus amount to each projectile.
        Dev Note: These passives were previously applying their bonus to the total amount of damage, rather than applying to each projectile. This results in an increase in damage to both, and makes them work as intended with guns that fire multiple pellets. 
    Corrected the chance of Maliwan Legendary Sniper Rifle Complex Root dropping as Phosphene.

Weekly Activities: 

Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on. 

    Pango Bango

The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed. These missions feature a guaranteed Legendary drop that you can repeatedly earn to get your ideal roll.

    Mission: Mob Rules (Healthy, Fortified, Regenerative)
    Legendary Gear Reward: Birt's Bees
