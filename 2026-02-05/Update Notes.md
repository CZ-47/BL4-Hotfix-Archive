Minor Update Notes - February 5, 2026

This Minor Update includes increased dedicated drop rates for Weekly Big Encore Boss fights, as well as a new set of Weekly Activities.

We made a few more drop rate changes this week to better support Ultimate Vault Hunter (UVH) scaling. Drop rewards have been feeling better with the added challenge, but we found that some bosses weren’t sharing the love like they were supposed to. 

We’ve also bumped up the dedicated drop rates for the Weekly Big Encore Bosses to match the broader changes over the past month, helping keep those rewards flowing for players who are still climbing towards higher UVH levels.

Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking.

If you're encountering any issues, please contact 2K Support for direct assistance. You can also read the PC Troubleshooting Guide, a list of known issues, or browse a list of Support threads here.
