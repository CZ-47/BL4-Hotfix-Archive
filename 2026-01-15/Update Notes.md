Minor Update Notes - January 15, 2026

This Minor Update includes a new set of Weekly Activities in addition to a permanent increase to dedicated drop rates and buffs for Harlowe and Amon players.

We loved seeing how much you enjoyed our Season's Looting and Triple Threat events during the holidays! You can look forward to more Limited-Time Big Encore events with multiple bosses in the future. 

From all the feedback we've seen, it’s clear to us how much you all enjoyed the limited-time drop rates we introduced for the duration of the Season’s Looting event. Once the event ended, we had an internal discussion about dedicated drop rates, factoring in both what we heard from you, the community, and our vision for how these drops should evolve.

Beginning this week, we are permanently increasing the dedicated drop rates on bosses. These changes are a careful way for us to balance the game so that loot drops feel like a meaningful increase from the base game. You’ll be able to get more loot faster without breaking the systems that make Borderlands 4 unique, like the Moxxi’s Big Encore machine. Looking ahead, we are working on ways to make loot even better in Ultimate Vault Hunter (UVH) modes to make sure harder levels always feel rewarding.

With tons of new free and paid content on the way, we have an exciting year ahead for Borderlands 4. Stay tuned for this month's Major Update, where we'll share more details on the content and updates you can expect in 2026!
Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking.
