Change List:

    The Gravitar Class Mod, Reactor, now drops from Inceptus as intended.
    The Order Legendary Grenade Skully has been adjusted to properly increase damage of projectiles at higher levels. Also addressed an audio issue with the fire effects that were causing it to not lower in volume with distance.
    Corrected the Knife Penetrator Augment, which was unintentionally setting all attacks to a 30% critical chance.
    Interacting with Dr. Zed’s Meds and Guns vending machines and Lost Loot machines will now reset any Action Skills, Ordnance, or Repkits currently on cooldown.
    Reduced the audio volume on the wings of world boss Spidananggal.
