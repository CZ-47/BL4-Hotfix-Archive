Major Update Notes - January 29, 2026

Welcome, Vault Hunters! Today's Major Update includes the addition of Photo Mode, a rework of Harlowe's Zero-Point Action Skill, and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode levels now increasing dedicated loot drop levels. This comes alongside a variety of improvements across gameplay, progression, gear, and visuals. And as always, we have a new set of Weekly Activities!

In addition to today's Major Update Notes, we've also just shared a Borderlands 4 2026 Roadmap with a look at what's coming to Kairos. Be sure to check it out and see what we've got planned this year, including paid content like Bounty Pack 2 and Story Pack 1, free feature additions like a level cap increase and cross-platform saves, and free endgame content for all players including a second raid boss and a Takedown.

Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking.

Thanks to improvements in recent versions of NVIDIA drivers, we no longer clear the game's GPU driver shader cache on first launch after updating to a new game version, when using NVIDIA GPU drivers version 590.xx or newer.

If you're encountering any issues, please contact 2K Support for direct assistance. You can also read the PC Troubleshooting Guide, a list of known issues, or browse a list of Support threads here.
New Content:
Photo Mode

Photo Mode is now available to all Borderlands 4 players, so you can capture mayhem-fueled moments or serene shots of Kairos' scenic beauty to share with your fellow Vault Hunters! Check out the Borderlands 4 Photo Mode guide for full details! You can access Photo Mode via the Pause Menu during gameplay.

While Photo Mode is active, you can adjust the position of the camera using the standard movement controls. The Photo Mode UI has multiple tabs with a wide range of settings with different visual effects. In single-player, going into Photo Mode will pause all the action by default, so you can freely dial in your ideal shot without missing the perfect moment!

Please note that Photo Mode is only available during gameplay, and cannot be accessed during cutscenes. It's also not available in splitscreen play on consoles.

    Get the perfect shot by adjusting the Field of View, Depth of Field, camera angles, and various visual filters.
    Change the time of day or toggle the visibility of Player Characters, Summons, NPCs, Enemies, and even Damage Numbers to clear the frame.

We always love seeing what you capture in-game, so be sure to tag @Borderlands on social media! You can also upload shots to the Screenshots section of the Borderlands 4 Steam Community hub!

Specializations

    Daredevil: Action Skill Cooldown rate has been adjusted to .5% and a multiplicative Action Skill Damage bonus has been added
    Runner: Melee Damage bonus is now a multiplicative instead of additive

Harlowe the Gravitar Skill Rework

Dev Note: We’re making several changes to Zero-Point as another step towards making this skill tree feel more satisfying and better balanced relative to Harlowe’s other trees. Because we're changing the fundamental behavior of Zero-Point to include the old Inertia Augment behavior in the base skill, we want to see how these changes balance out before doing more work in the rest of the tree. 

We have our eye on a few other passives that may be candidates for some buffs, but between the recent passive buffs that were implemented several weeks ago, combined with today’s changes, we’ll revisit those in the future once we’ve gathered adequate feedback on the current changes.

Long term, we want to ensure that each Vault Hunter has plenty of build diversity, with each Action Skill having its own pros and cons. If and when we see one falling behind, we’ll continue to explore changes like today’s.

    Zero-Point (Base Skill): Now includes the benefits of the previous "Inertia" Augment. Killing an enemy in Stasis now resets the duration, searches for a new target, and makes the duration decrease faster
    Inertia Augment (Changed): Updated to increase Harlowe’s Slam Damage. Whenever she slams an enemy, create Mini Unstable Energy Pocket projectiles that randomly deal Cryo or Radiation damage. Additionally, she also gains increased Status Effect Damage and Status Effect Chance. This effect stacks.

Amon the Forgeknight

    Amon now consistently deals bonus Cryo Damage when equipping Cryonic Thrum Augment in multiplayer
    Prevented unintended increases in the number of segments in the Vault Hunter bar when Amon activates his Action Skill
    Dragon’s Breath now applies properly to Ripper Heavy Weapons with beams
    Firewall Forgeskill will now block Moon-Maddened Callis projectile attacks

Vex the Siren

    Addressed the cooldown for Prismatic Ichors sometimes resetting when applying a status effect
    Phase Pocket Passive no longer resets the Taser underbarrel magazine when using a Vladof Enhancement
    Addressed Incarnate Action Skill behavior so that it continues to work while using the Vibe Check Capstone with the Legendary Class Mod Technomancer
