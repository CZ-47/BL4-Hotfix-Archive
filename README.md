# Borderlands 4 Hotfix Archive


## Description

An attempt at keeping an archive of Hotfix files with date stamps and Hotfix/Patch notes as seen on https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/

Unlike Apocalyptech's version in BL3/TTWL, there's nothing automated about this repo.
Hotfix files are downloaded on game launch, so this repo won't be updated until I'm capable of launching the game and grabbing said files or after they're being sent over.
Shortly after, a new directory is added with the appropriate date containing the Patch/Hotfix notes and hopefully a zipped up folder with the hotfix files.

# Notes
This archive was started very late. As a result many hotfix files are missing unfortunately.

There are either no or incomplete hotfix files for following date ranges:

    2025-09-11 - 2025-09-15
    2025-10-30 - 2025-12-11
