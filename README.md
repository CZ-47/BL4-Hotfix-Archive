# Borderlands 4 Hotfix Archive


## Description

An attempt at keeping an archive of hotfix files with date stamps and hotfix notes as seen on https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/

Unlike Apocalyptech's version in BL3/TTWL, there's nothing automated about this repo.
As new patches and hotfixes go live, a new directory is made with the appropriate date containing the Patch/Hotfix notes and hopefully a zipped up folder with the hotfix files.
