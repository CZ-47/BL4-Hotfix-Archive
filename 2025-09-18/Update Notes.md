Weekly Minor Updates:  

Every week, we will see changes to which Weekly Big Encore Boss and Wildcard Mission is live! Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine is also on the move! 
Weekly Big Encore Boss 

The Weekly Big Encore Boss is a tougher variant of an existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool. 
Weekly Wildcard Missions 

Weekly Wildcard Missions add challenging new traits to an existing mission. These missions feature a guaranteed Legendary drop that you can repeatedly earn to get your ideal roll. 
Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine 

Go in search of where the Black Market Vending Machine has moved to and discover what’s available in your game every week. Remember, while the location is the same, your vending machine items are different from other players, so ask around to see if someone has the item you’re looking for!  

You can read more on the weekly changes in our endgame overview post.
