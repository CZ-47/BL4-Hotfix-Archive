Borderlands 4 Update Notes - October 9, 2025

This update for Borderlands 4 refreshes the Weekly Activities, adjusts some Legendary gear values, and addresses concerns reported by the community. 

After last week’s large set of changes, we wanted to focus on some smaller gear adjustments. We’re continuing to monitor feedback to the Vault Hunter changes and identifying areas to make further improvements. 

Looking forward to next week, we are planning another round of adjustments that will focus on Class Mods, Repkits, Shields, and Firmware being tuned to provide greater viability for melee builds, and account for deficiencies in other specific Vault Hunter builds. We will also address unintended interactions in certain Vault Hunter skills, and make adjustments to overperforming gear. Importantly, next week's update will include a host of improvements to stability, performance, and some highly requested quality-of-life changes!

Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking.
