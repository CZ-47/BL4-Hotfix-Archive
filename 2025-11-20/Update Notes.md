Update Notes - November 20, 2025
Major Update Notes

Welcome, Vault Hunters! Today’s update delivers some key community-requested improvements, smarter loot drops, and a new Legendary Loot Indicator for your radar. These are alongside major improvements, visual polish, and stability updates for a smoother experience on Kairos.

Beyond today’s update, the team is hard at work on a host of other highly requested quality-of-life features. Work on Photo Mode is wrapping up, while other updates like support for multiple active Big Encore Machines and more options for scaling difficulty are coming (we’ll talk more about these closer to their launch). Further into the future, we’re looking at ways to improve shared character progression, add additional endgame-focused activities (did someone say Takedown?), launch Cross-Save support, and more.

Now that we're post-launch, we want to break down how we deliver updates to you! We have two main kinds:

"Minor Updates" will take care of any smaller, more pressing issues outside of the planned update schedule (primarily balance changes, if needed). They also refresh the three types of Weekly Activities: the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Weekly Wildcard Mission, and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine location. Minor Updates are scheduled weekly on Thursdays.

"Major Updates" deliver larger-scale changes, including new content, more sweeping balance adjustments, performance improvements, and the addressing of any reported issues. Major Updates are less common, and are planned to deploy about a month apart.

With all of today’s changes though, we hope you can feel the positive effects in gameplay as you experience How Rush Saved Mercenary Day and make progress on your Vault Cards! 
Change List:


Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day

We're stoked for you to team up with Rush and teach Minister Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day! This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year. However, the team realized that there was more mayhem than time when it came to getting as much into Bounty Pack 1 as originally planned while never slowing down in their mission to improve the Borderlands 4 player experience. 

So in the spirit of the season, we're giving a gift to all Borderlands 4 players by making Bounty Pack 1 free!* Thank you for all the passion and support you've given us as a community. We're hard at work making sure future Bounty Packs are more fully loaded with the compelling content players have been asking for. In addition, we're now adding a new Bounty Pack 5 (more on that in a bit); there's a lot of amazing stuff coming to Borderlands 4, so stay tuned!

    Added support for How Rush Saved Mercenary Day content! Jump into this free content today by finding and interacting with the gift-wrapped present (marked on your map as a new mission) in any major hub, which will initiate the mission to assist Rush!
    Added support for the Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card! Playing Borderlands 4 with a Vault Card active gives you more loot and XP via Daily and Weekly challenges, and it can be leveled up at your own pace (no time limits or expiring rewards here). You can activate it via the Vault Card screen in your ECHO menu. Vault Card progression works just like leveling up: it's all driven by how much XP you're gaining. By exploring Kairos, killing enemies, and completing quests, you'll fill up your Vault Card progression in addition to your regular XP!
        This includes 4 new pieces of rerollable gear and 24 new cosmetics to earn!

*How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is the first of five post-launch DLC Bounty Packs coming to Borderlands 4. How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is free for all players, while Bounty Packs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are included with Borderlands 4 Deluxe Edition, Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition, the Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack Bundle, and will be available for separate purchase. Base game required to play content.
Notable Changes

We wanted to pull these out specifically as they have been heavily mentioned in the community. 

    Updated the Weekly Wildcard Missions to set additional start points in missions
    Dev Note: This feature will allow future Weekly Wildcard Missions to jump straight to the meat of a mission.
    Class Mods have been adjusted to drop more for your current character
    Converted the Phosphene weapon challenge from character-based to profile-wide progression
        Dev Note: This long-term grind is aimed at our most dedicated community members who invest the most time in the game. Still, we agree that completing this collection is more a reflection of your dedication to the game and not to a specific Vault Hunter. This is the first example of allowing more progression to be shared between all characters on your account.
    Updated the loot feed to display total current currency after spending or receiving money
    Reduced the likelihood of unintended movements or knockbacks while reviving a teammate
        Dev Note: When reviving another player, the reviving player is temporarily given more mass, making enemy attacks less likely to bounce you away from your partner.
    Added a new Legendary Loot Indicator to the combat radar for easier identification of high-rarity drops

Gameplay & Mission Progression
