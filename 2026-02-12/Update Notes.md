Minor Update Notes - February 12, 2026


This Minor Update includes a limited-time twist on enemy traits in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, an adjustment to Vex's Teen Witch Class Mod, and a new set of Weekly Activities themed around spreading the love across Kairos (including the pink-heart-firing Acey May Shotgun as the Legendary loot for the Weekly Wildcard Mission!). We're also running a new Community Challenge from February 12-16, so make sure to lovingly revive other Vault Hunters in co-op this weekend to do your part; [read the full details here](https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/news/feb-2026-community-challenge/)!

For this Minor Update, enemies in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode (UVH) are showing that they care with a kinder set of modifiers. While in UVH, enemies you encounter will be more likely to have the Wealthy or Bougie traits that make them drop extra cash or Eridium respectively. Any enemies who get a damage-related trait have an increased chance to have Chain Master, clearly indicating their loving bonds. These effects will be active from February 12 to 19, so make the most of them!

Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking.
