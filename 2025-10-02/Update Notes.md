Borderlands 4 Update Notes - October 2, 2025

This update includes some additional balance changes and updates for Vault Hunters.

Welcome to our first significant balance patch! Our high level goal for Borderlands 4 is to always provide players with the tools and means to build their perfect Vault Hunter. Through the combination of gear, Firmware, Skill and Specialization trees, we want players to experiment and craft theories, then put them to the test in combat.

For today's update, we wanted to focus on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon in particular gets a host of adjustments to bring him closer in line with the general power level of the other Vault Hunters. Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power see adjustment to make those builds more viable in the late endgame. Finally, Harlowe has a couple tweaks to make sure Stasis is getting value for players.

Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity. We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.

We're excited about the future of Borderlands 4 and its upcoming Post-Launch Roadmap. This is just the start of an exciting year of updates and content, and we can't wait to experience it all with our community.
Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking.

Change List: 
Weekly Activities: 

    Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on. 
    The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed. These missions feature a guaranteed Legendary drop that you can repeatedly earn to get your ideal roll.
    Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has moved to another location and changed its offerings. Remember, while the location is the same, your vending machine items are different from other players, so ask around to see if someone has the item you’re looking for!

Additional Changes: 

    Added auto-clearing of Borderlands 4 stale shaders on version update, preventing performance degradation on some PCs.
