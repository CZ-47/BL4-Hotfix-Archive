Minor Update Notes - December 18, 2025

Triple Threat

As we head into the holidays, we want to extend our gratitude to everyone playing Borderlands 4; this community is beyond badass, and we're endlessly appreciative of your passion and feedback. We're stoked to bring you even more mayhem in 2026!

To close out 2025, we're mixing things up with a Triple Threat of Big Encore Bosses and a Season's Lootings increase to Legendary drop rates for bosses! Starting today, this Triple Threat will feature THREE True Bosses at once while our team logs off to celebrate Mercenary Day with our loved ones. We'll resume a weekly rotation of bosses with our Minor Update on January 8, 2026! 

Meanwhile, during Season's Lootings you'll be up to 5x more likely to get a Legendary drop (outside of Big Encore Bosses and Bloomreaper) as you grind for loot while this effect is live, also until January 8!  Legendary loot drops will still be infrequent enough to feel special, in keeping with our overall design intent.

This Minor Update covers Weekly Activities from December 18, 2025 to January 8, 2026 while we take time off for some holiday R&R. There will be no change to Weekly Activities on January 1, 2026. 

We're hard at work on your 2026 content, including new Bounty Packs, your first Story Pack, and a Takedown! While we work on these longer-lead projects though, we want to know what weekly endgame activities you want to see more (or less!) of.

Take our survey here, and help us shape your weekly rotations in 2026!
Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking. We'll see you in the new year, Vault Hunter!
