Major Update Notes - December 11, 2025

Welcome, Vault Hunters! Today’s update includes support for the addition of Bloomreaper the Invincible, True Mode, and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode 6. This comes alongside a variety of improvements across gameplay, summons behavior, gear, visuals. We’ve done a lot of work to boost performance, refine gear, and improve the splitscreen and menu usability in this update. Thank you for the continued feedback and reports that are being sent in. There are more updates on the way! 
Bloomreaper the Invincible

Welcome to The Bloom, home of the rotting parasitic god: Bloomreaper the Invincible. Descend into the sinkhole and take it down before corruption blooms across the world. You’ll be tested on your ability to survive with your movement abilities in addition to your might and firepower. You can read full details in our Bloomreaper the Invincible article.

The Bloomreaper raid boss introduces nine new Legendaries you can farm as dedicated drops: five new pieces of gear and four new Class Mods. But the majority of that new loot will only drop if you can beat Bloomreaper quick enough in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM), the amped-up difficulty setting you can learn about in our Borderlands 4 endgame explainer.

This introduces a timer for your raid run, so do your best to deal death as rapidly as possible. When this ferocious flora finally bites the dust, you'll be rewarded with a chest full of loot including tiers of bonus rewards. Depending on your completion time, the Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum-tier rewards you get from this chest will be increasingly powerful. You'll be able to clearly see how much time you have left to hit a certain tier via your mission tracker.

    Added a new arena: The Bloom
    Added Bloomreaper the Invincible 
    Added new Legendary gear to Bloomreaper’s dedicated loot pool:
        Rainmaker - Ripper Sniper Rifle (guaranteed drop for Platinum-tier rewards in UVHM)
        Mantra - Maliwan Shotgun
        Undershield - Vladof Shield
        Urchin - Tediore Ordnance (Grenade)
        Jett-Setter - Ripper Ordnance (Heavy Weapon)
        Misericorde - Siren Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)
        Overdriver - Exo-Soldier Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)
        Trooper - Gravitar Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)
        Lamplighter - Forgeknight Class Mod (can only drop for Silver-tier or higher rewards in UVHM)

True Mode

Dev Note: We wanted to provide a greater challenge to players who have spent the time to perfect their mightiest builds. True Mode scales up all enemies as if you were playing in a 4-player party, regardless of your current party size. That means your opponents will be tougher to take down, far more numerous, and have more Badass elites among their ranks.

True Mode is found in the Session Settings menu and works independently of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, allowing Vault Hunters to have the most control over their difficulty. 

    Added support for True Mode, a new difficulty that is always scaled for a party of 4 regardless of the amount of players. The change here ups that balance to provide a greater challenge to those who are ready to take it on. This new difficulty mode is available when a player has completed the campaign.

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode 6

It is time for a greater challenge.

    Added support for UVHM 6
    Added new UVHM challenge
    Added new Firmware: Skillcraft, only available in UVHM 6. 

Skillcraft tiers make your Action Skills even more dangerous to your enemies. 

    Tier 1: Skill Damage +10%
    Tier 2: Skill Critical Chance +10%
    Tier 3: Dealing Skill Damage increases Skill Damage Dealt by 2% for 10 seconds. Max 25 Stacks

    Trouble now has a "Blink Melee Attack" that will occur every 12 seconds if too far from the target, causing them to immediately teleport and attack. This should make Trouble much more responsive in the heat of combat

A note from the dev team:

Over the past few months, the team has been investigating how to deliver the best runtime performance possible with Borderlands 4. Since launching, we've discovered a number of fixes that deliver noticeable framerate boosts and reduce stuttering without making sacrifices in visual quality. Some of the fixes are improvements to our code or content; other fixes come from later versions of Epic's Unreal Engine. See below for more details.

However, we still have much more to do here. We're in this for the long haul, and over the coming months we'll roll out even more performance improvements. We appreciate the community's feedback, and your patience!

    Improved the performance cost of many UI elements (menus, HUD, and overlays) without lowering visual quality
    The game now uses Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO), which allows the executable to run more efficiently and brings large CPU performance gains
    Encouraged smoother gameplay by reducing gameplay hitches caused by shader and PSO (Pipeline State Object) compilation
    Optimized grass, shrubs, and other foliage by updating their meshes and materials, reducing the cost of drawing them on screen
    Added several GPU optimizations pulled in from newer versions of Unreal Engine
    Improved the performance of the Lumen lighting system
    Improved the performance of foliage reflections and water
    Additional performance improvements for minimum-spec PCs in areas with grass, dynamic shadows, and wind effects
    In-engine cinematics now run at higher framerates, instead of being capped at 30 FPS 
    Adjusted AI/NPC spawn counts in certain areas so enemies and NPCs no longer spawn in higher numbers than intended, improving both performance and gameplay flow
    Removal of unnecessary extra lights, especially lights used for supporting volumetric clouds.
    Improvements to Physics and Niagara to reduce memory leaks and Out-of-Memory crashes
    Improvements to Cloth initialization to reduce load and spawn cost time.
    Added new graphics options that lets players turn off shadows, volumetric clouds, and fog, offering better performance flexibility
    Improved how VRAM is used by reorganizing texture and mesh memory pools, allowing the game to keep better visual quality at lower graphics settings without hurting performance
    General stability improvements
